Each of the drills in this C# repository are short simple programs that teach a specific concept.
In the projects file, The ContosoUniversity project is an Entity Framework 6 Code First tutorial using MVC 5.  This tutorial uses the Code First workflow.  In this tutorial I used Visual Studio to create an MVC web app using the ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework).  
In this tutorial I learned:
- How to create the data model
- Set up the database context
- Initialize the database with test data
- Create controllers and views
- Implement basic CRUD functionality
- Add column sorts and paging
- Enable migrations

After going through this tutorial I built the Entity Framework web application, CinemaFilms, using the Code First workflow.  This application creates the data model and database context then initializes the database with movie data.  The HomeController displays the main page for the Peak Films Cinema.  The ShowtimesController displays the movies that are currently playing.  The showtimes for a particular movie are displayed when the details link is clicked.
